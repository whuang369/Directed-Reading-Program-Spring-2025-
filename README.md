I participated in [Directed Reading Program with topics about graph theory in Spring 2025](https://wiki.math.wisc.edu/index.php/Directed_Reading_Program_Spring_2025). In the beginning of the program, I am matched with a graduate mentor. We meet once a week to discuss topics related to graph theory and assign tasks for the week. Generally, I solve 3-4 problems and read about one chapter each week, bringing my results to my mentor in the next meeting.

Our topic explores graph theory from a proofs based perspective with a few algorithms on graphs (beyond Dijkstra's). The study will follow Douglas West's: Introduction to Graph Theory very closely. Ideally, the study would cover some preliminary concepts of the following:
1. Basic concepts 
2. Connectivity
3. Bipartite (Non-bipartite if time permits) matchings
4. Graph colouring Algorithms such as Edmonds-Karp for network flow would be included as it covers both parts 2 and 3. 

This repo holds files including my solutions for weekly problem sets, codes (mainly Python) for implementation of algorithms, study notes, and the final presentation.
